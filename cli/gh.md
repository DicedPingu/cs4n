# gh - moved to unified GitHub guide
# Use `cli/github.md` as the canonical file for gh + git workflows.

## Where to go now
- Auth/setup: `cli/github.md` sections `2)` and `3)`.
- Repo creation/clone: `cli/github.md` section `5) Create a repository`.
- PR/CI/release flow: `cli/github.md` section `9) Pull requests, issues, releases, and CI`.
- AI-assisted branch flow: `cli/github.md` section `8) AI-assisted workflow`.
