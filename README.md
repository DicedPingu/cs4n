# Guides
Short, practical cheatsheets for daily workflows.

## Structure
- `cli/` — git/gh/wget/rg/tmux and CLI workflows
- `pkg/` — npm/uv/pub/pip and package managers
- `dev/` — flutter, flutter-pub, cargo, python
- `build/` — make, cmake
- `system/` — docker, docker-compose
- `linux/` — common Unix tools (grep, find, ssh, systemctl, etc.)
- `pop-og/` — Pop!_OS specific notes

Tip: open a file and skim sections in order (setup → common flow → options).
