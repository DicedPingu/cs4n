# Package Manager Guides
Use these to install, update, lock, and publish dependencies safely.

## Start order
1. `uv.md` for modern Python workflows.
2. `pip.md` when you need classic pip behavior.
3. `npm.md` for Node projects.
4. `npm-pub.md` for npm package release workflows.
5. `pub.md` for Dart package workflows.

## Practical rule
- Prefer lockfile-based installs (`uv sync`, `npm ci`) for reproducible environments.
