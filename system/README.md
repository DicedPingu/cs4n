# System Container Guides
Use these for Docker images and multi-service stacks.

## Start order
1. `docker.md` for image/container fundamentals.
2. `docker-compose.md` for multi-container app stacks.

## Practical rule
- Use `docker system df` or `docker compose config` before cleanup/redeploy operations.
