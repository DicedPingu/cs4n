# xargs

`xargs` (extended arguments) is a command used to build and execute command lines from standard input. It is particularly useful when you need to run a command on a long list of files generated by another command like `find` or `grep`.

## Basic Usage

The general syntax is to pipe the output of one command into `xargs`:

```bash
command1 | xargs command2
```

## Common Examples

### deleting files found by find
One of the most common uses is deleting files matching a pattern.

```bash
# Find all .tmp files and delete them
find . -name "*.tmp" | xargs rm
```

### Handling filenames with spaces
By default, `xargs` splits input by spaces/newlines. If filenames contain spaces, use `-print0` with `find` and `-0` with `xargs`.

```bash
find . -name "*.png" -print0 | xargs -0 rm
```

### Running multiple commands in parallel
You can use `-P` to run processes in parallel, which speeds up tasks.

```bash
# Convert images using 4 parallel processes
find . -name "*.jpg" | xargs -P 4 -I {} convert {} {}.png
```

### Previewing commands
Use `-p` to prompt before execution or `-t` to print the command before executing.

```bash
ls *.txt | xargs -p rm
```
