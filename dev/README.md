# Dev Guides
Use these for language/framework development loops.

## Start order
1. `python.md` and `pkg/uv.md` for Python projects.
2. `flutter.md` then `flutter-pub.md` for Flutter apps.
3. `cargo.md` for Rust projects.

## Practical rule
- Keep one source of truth for dependencies per project (lockfile-driven where possible).
